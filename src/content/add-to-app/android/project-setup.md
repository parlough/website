description: Learn how to integrate a Flutter module into your existing Android project.
---

Flutter can be embedded into your existing Android
application piecemeal, as a source code Gradle
subproject or as AARs.

The integration flow can be done using the Android Studio
IDE with the [Flutter plugin][] or manually.

:::warning
  Your existing Android app might support architectures
  such as `mips` or `x86`. Flutter currently [only supports][]
  building ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled libraries
  for `x86_64`, `armeabi-v7a`, and `arm64-v8a`.

  Consider using the [`abiFilters`][] Android Gradle
  Plugin API to limit the supported architectures in your APK.
  Doing this avoids a missing `libflutter.so` runtime crash,
  for example:

```gradle title="MyApp/app/build.gradle"
android {
  //...
  defaultConfig {
    ndk {
      // Filter for architectures supported by Flutter.
      abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86_64'
    }
  }
}
```

  The Flutter engine has an `x86` and `x86_64` version.
  When using an emulator in debug Just-In-Time (JIT) mode,
  the Flutter module still runs correctly.

### Integrate with Android Studio
{:.no_toc}

The Android Studio IDE can help integrate your Flutter module.
Using Android Studio, you can edit both your Android and Flutter code
in the same IDE.

You can also use IntelliJ Flutter plugin functionality like
Dart code completion, hot reload, and widget inspector.

Android Studio supports add-to-app flows on Android Studio 2022.2 or later
with the [Flutter plugin][] for IntelliJ.
To build your app, the Android Studio plugin configures your
Android project to add your Flutter module as a dependency.

1. Open your Android project in Android Studio.

1. Go to **File** > **New** > **New Project...**.
    The **New Project** dialog displays.

1. Click **Flutter**.

1. If asked to provide your **Flutter SDK path**, do so and click **Next**.

1. Complete the configuration of your Flutter module.

    * If you have an existing project:

        {: type="a"}
        1. To choose an existing project, click **...**
           to the right of the **Project location** box.
        1. Navigate to your Flutter project directory.
        1. Click **Open**.

    * If you need to create a new Flutter project:

        {: type="a"}
        1. Complete the configuration dialog.
        1. In the **Project type** menu, select **Module**.

1. Click **Finish**.

:::tip
  By default, your project's Project pane might show the 'Android' view.
  If you can't see your new Flutter files in the Project pane,
  set your Project pane to display **Project Files**.
  This shows all files without filtering.

### Integrate without Android Studio
{:.no_toc}

To integrate a Flutter module with an existing Android app
manually, without using Flutter's Android Studio plugin,
follow these steps:

#### Create a Flutter module
{:.no_toc}

Let's assume that you have an existing Android app at
`some/path/MyApp`, and that you want your Flutter
project as a sibling:

```terminal
cd some/path/
flutter create -t module --org com.example flutter_module
```

This creates a `some/path/flutter_module/` Flutter module project
with some Dart code to get you started and an `.android/`
hidden subfolder. The `.android` folder contains an
Android project that can both help you run a barebones
standalone version of your Flutter module via `flutter run`
and it's also a wrapper that helps bootstrap the Flutter
module an embeddable Android library.

:::note
  Add custom Android code to your own existing
  application's project or a plugin,
  not to the module in `.android/`.
  Changes made in your module's `.android/`
  directory won't appear in your existing Android
  project using the module.

  Do not source control the `.android/` directory
  since it's autogenerated. Before building the
  module on a new machine, run `flutter pub get`
  in the `flutter_module` directory first to regenerate
  the `.android/` directory before building the
  Android project using the Flutter module.
:::

:::note
  To avoid Dex merging issues, `flutter.androidPackage` should
  not be identical to your host app's package name.
:::

#### Java version requirement
{:.no_toc}

Flutter requires your project to declare compatibility with Java 11 or later.

Before attempting to connect your Flutter module project
to your host Android app, ensure that your host Android
app declares the following source compatibility within your
app's `build.gradle` file, under the `android { }` block.

```gradle title="MyApp/app/build.gradle"
android {
  //...
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility 11 // The minimum value
    targetCompatibility 11 // The minimum value
  }
}
```

#### Centralize repository settings
{:.no_toc}

Starting with Gradle 7, Android recommends using centralized repository
declarations in `settings.gradle` instead of project or module level
declarations in `build.gradle` files.

Before attempting to connect your Flutter module project to your
host Android app, make the following changes.

1. Remove the `repositories` block in all of your app's `build.gradle` files.

   ```groovy
   // Remove the following block, starting on the next line
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
       }
   // ...to the previous line
   ```

1. Add the `dependencyResolutionManagement` displayed in this step to the
   `settings.gradle` file.

   ```groovy
   dependencyResolutionManagement {
     repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_SETTINGS)
     repositories {
       google()
       mavenCentral()
     }
   }
   ```

## Add the Flutter module as a dependency

Add the Flutter module as a dependency of your
existing app in Gradle. You can achieve this in two ways.

1. **Android archive**
    The AAR mechanism creates generic Android AARs as
    intermediaries that packages your Flutter module.
    This is good when your downstream app builders don't
    want to have the Flutter SDK installed. But,
    it adds one more build step if you build frequently.

1. **Module source code**
    The source code subproject mechanism is a convenient
    one-click build process, but requires the Flutter SDK.
    This is the mechanism used by the Android Studio IDE plugin.

</ul>

### Depend on the Android Archive (AAR)
{:.no_toc}

This option packages your Flutter library as a generic local
Maven repository composed of AARs and POMs artifacts.
This option allows your team to build the host app without
installing the Flutter SDK. You can then distribute the
artifacts from a local or remote repository.

Let's assume you built a Flutter module at
`some/path/flutter_module`, and then run:

```terminal
cd some/path/flutter_module
flutter build aar
```

Then, follow the on-screen instructions to integrate.

{% include docs/app-figure.md image="development/add-to-app/android/project-setup/build-aar-instructions.png" %}

More specifically, this command creates
(by default all debug/profile/release modes)
a [local repository][], with the following files:

```nocode
build/host/outputs/repo
└── com
    └── example
        └── flutter_module
            ├── flutter_release
            │   ├── 1.0
            │   │   ├── flutter_release-1.0.aar
            │   │   ├── flutter_release-1.0.aar.md5
            │   │   ├── flutter_release-1.0.aar.sha1
            │   │   ├── flutter_release-1.0.pom
            │   │   ├── flutter_release-1.0.pom.md5
            │   │   └── flutter_release-1.0.pom.sha1
            │   ├── maven-metadata.xml
            │   ├── maven-metadata.xml.md5
            │   └── maven-metadata.xml.sha1
            ├── flutter_profile
            │   ├── ...
            └── flutter_debug
                └── ...
```

To depend on the AAR, the host app must be able
to find these files.

To do that, edit `settings.gradle` in your host app
so that it includes the local repository and the dependency:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_SETTINGS)
  repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()

  // Add the new repositories starting on the next line...
    maven {
      url 'some/path/flutter_module/build/host/outputs/repo'
      // This is relative to the location of the build.gradle file
      // if using a relative path.
    }
    maven {
      url 'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io'
    }
  // ...to before this line  
  }
}

```
</br>

### Kotlin DSL based Android Project

After an `aar` build of a Kotlin DSL-based Android project,
follow these steps to add the flutter_module.

Include the flutter module as a dependency in 
the Android project's `app/build.gradle` file.

```gradle title="MyApp/app/build.gradle.kts"
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
          ...
        }
        debug {
          ...
        }
        create("profile") {
            initWith(getByName("debug"))
        }
}
dependencies {
  // ...
  debugImplementation "com.example.flutter_module:flutter_debug:1.0"
  releaseImplementation 'com.example.flutter_module:flutter_release:1.0'
  add("profileImplementation", "com.example.flutter_module:flutter_profile:1.0")
}
```

The `profileImplementation` ID is a custom `configuration` to be
implemented in the `app/build.gradle` file of a host project.

```gradle title="host-project/app/build.gradle.kts"
configurations {
    getByName("profileImplementation") {
    }
}
```

```gradle title="MyApp/settings.gradle.kts"
include(":app")

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven(url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io")
        maven(url = "some/path/flutter_module_project/build/host/outputs/repo")
    }
}
```

:::important
  If you're located in China, use a mirror site rather than the
  `storage.googleapis.com` domain. To learn more about mirror sites,
  check out [Using Flutter in China][] page.

:::tip
  You can also build an AAR for your Flutter module in Android Studio using
  the `Build > Flutter > Build AAR` menu.

### Depend on the module's source code
{:.no_toc}

This option enables a one-step build for both your
Android project and Flutter project. This option is
convenient when you work on both parts simultaneously
and rapidly iterate, but your team must install the
Flutter SDK to build the host app.

:::tip
  By default, the host app provides the `:app` Gradle project.
  To change the name of this project, set
  `flutter.hostAppProjectName` in the Flutter module's
  `gradle.properties` file.
  Include this project in the host app's `settings.gradle` file.
:::

Include the Flutter module as a subproject in the host app's
`settings.gradle`. This example assumes `flutter_module` and `MyApp`
exist in the same directory

```groovy title="MyApp/settings.gradle"
// Include the host app project.
include ':app'                                    // assumed existing content
setBinding(new Binding([gradle: this]))                                // new
evaluate(new File(                                                     // new
    settingsDir.parentFile,                                            // new
    'flutter_module/.android/include_flutter.groovy'                   // new
))                                                                     // new
```

The binding and script evaluation allows the Flutter
module to `include` itself (as `:flutter`) and any
Flutter plugins used by the module (such as `:package_info` and `:video_player`)
in the evaluation context of your `settings.gradle`.

Introduce an `implementation` dependency on the Flutter
module from your app:

```groovy title="MyApp/app/build.gradle"
dependencies {
    implementation project(':flutter')
}
```

</div>
</div>
{% comment %} End: Tab panes. {% endcomment -%}

Your app now includes the Flutter module as a dependency.
