{{site.alert.note}}
  The HTML backend doesn't support the `FragmentProgram` API.
  The `CanvasKit` backend will support this API in a future release.

A shader is a program executed by the GPU and usually authored in a small,
Dart-like language, such as GLSL. User-authored shaders can be added to
Flutter projects using the [`FragmentProgram`][] API.
You can use custom shaders to provide rich graphical effects beyond those
provided by the Flutter SDK.

[`FragmentProgram`]: {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/FragmentProgram-class.html

## Adding shaders to an application

Shaders must be declared in the `shaders` section of your project's `pubspec.yaml` file.
The Flutter command-line tool compiles the shader to its appropriate backend format,
as well as generates the necessary runtime metadata.
When running in debug mode, changes to a shader program
triggers recompilation and updates the shader during hot reload or hot
restart.

```yaml
flutter:
  shaders:
    - shaders/myshader.frag
```

Shaders from packages are added to a project using the same technique as other assets.

#### Loading shaders at runtime

Load a `FragmentProgram` at runtime using the [`FragmentProgram.fromAsset`][]
constructor. Specify the path to the shader in the `pubspec.yaml` file, as shown above.

[`FragmentProgram.fromAsset`]: https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FragmentProgram/fromAsset.html

```dart
void loadMyShader() async {
  var program = await FragmentProgram.fromAsset('shaders/myshader.frag');
}
```

The FragmentProgram object can be used to create one or more FragmentShader
instances. A FragmentShader object represents a fragment program along with
a particular set of uniforms.

```dart
void updateShader(Canvas canvas, Rect rect, FragmentProgram program) {
  var shader = program.createShader();
  shader.setFloat(0, 42.0);
  canvas.drawRect(rect, Paint()..shader = shader);
}
```

## Canvas API

Fragment shaders can be used with most Canvas APIs by setting [`Paint.shader`][].
For example, when using [`Canvas.drawRect`][] the shader is evaluated for all
fragments within the rectangle. For an API like [`Canvas.drawPath`][] with a
stroked path, the shader is evaluated for all fragments within the stroked
line. Some APIs, such as [`Canvas.drawImage`][], ignore the value of the shader.

[`Canvas.drawImage`]:  {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/drawImage.html
[`Canvas.drawRect`]:    {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/drawRect.html
[`Canvas.drawPath`]:    {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/drawPath.html
[`Paint.shader`]:            {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/Paint/shader.html


```dart
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size, FragmentShader shader) {
  // Draws a rectangle with the shader used as a color source.
  canvas.drawRect(
    Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, size.width, size.height),
    Paint()..shader = shader,
  );

  // Draws a stroked rectangle with the shader only applied to the fragments
  // that lie within the stroke.
  canvas.drawRect(
    Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, size.width, size.height),
    Paint()
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
      ..shader = shader,
  )
}

```

## Authoring shaders

Shaders are authored as GLSL source files.
Any GLSL version from 460 down to 100 is supported,
though some available features are restricted.
The rest of the examples in this document use version `460 core`.

Also note the following special cases:

* UBOs and SSBOs aren't supported
* `sampler2D` is the only supported sampler type
* Only the two-argument version of `texture` (sampler and uv) is supported
* No additional varying inputs may be declared
* All precision hints are ignored when targeting Skia
* Unsigned integers and booleans aren't supported

#### Uniforms

Configure a fragment program by defining `uniform` values in the GLSL shader
source and then setting these values in Dart for each fragment shader instance.

Set the `uniform` value using the [`FragmentShader.setFloat`][] or
[`FragmentShader.setImageSampler`][] methods, depending on the _type_Ëœ of uniform value.
In GLSL, floating point values includes `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, and `vec4` types.
A GLSL sampler value is a `sampler2D` type.

The correct index for each `uniform` value is determined by the order that the uniform values
are defined in the fragment program. For data types composed of
multiple floats, such as a `vec4`, you must call [`FragmentShader.setFloat`][]
once for each value.

[`FragmentShader.setFloat`]: https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FragmentShader/setFloat.html
[`FragmentShader.setImageSampler`]: https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FragmentShader/setImageSampler.html

For example, given the following uniforms declarations in a GLSL fragment program:

```glsl
uniform float uScale;
uniform sampler2D uTexture;
uniform vec2 uMagnitude;
uniform vec4 uColor;
```

The corresponding Dart code to initialize these `uniform` values is
as follows:

```dart
void updateShader(FragmentShader shader, Color color, Image image) {
  shader.setFloat(0, 23);  // uScale
  shader.setFloat(1, 114); // uMagnitude x
  shader.setFloat(2, 83);  // uMagnitude y

  // Convert color to premultiplied opacity.
  shader.setFloat(3, color.red / 255 * color.opacity);   // uColor r
  shader.setFloat(4, color.green / 255 * color.opacity); // uColor g
  shader.setFloat(5, color.blue / 255 * color.opacity);  // uColor b
  shader.setFloat(6, color.opacity);                     // uColor a

  // Initialize sampler uniform.
  shader.setImageSampler(0, image);
 }
 ```

Note how the indexes used does not count the `sampler2D` uniform. This uniform
will be set separately with [`FragmentShader.setImageSampler`][], with the
index starting over at 0.

Any float uniforms that are left uninitialized will default to `0`.

#### Current position

The shader has access to a `varying` value that contains the local coordinates for
the particular fragment being evaluated. Use this feature to compute
effects that depend on the current position, which can be accessed by
importing the `flutter/runtime_effect.glsl` library and calling the
`FlutterFragCoord` function . For example:

```glsl
#include <flutter/runtime_effect.glsl>

void main() {
  vec2 currentPos = FlutterFragCoord().xy;
}
```

The value returned from `FlutterFragCoord` is distinct from `gl_FragCoord`.
`gl_FragCoord` provides the screen space coordinates and should generally be
avoided to ensure that shaders are consistent across backends. When targeting a
Skia backend, the calls to `gl_FragCoord` are rewritten to access local
coordinates but this rewriting isn't possible with Impeller.

#### Colors

There isn't a built-in data type for colors. Instead they are commonly
represented as a `vec4` with each component corresponding to one of the RGBA
color channels.

The single output `fragColor` expects that the color value is normalized to be
in the range of `0.0` to `1.0` and that it has premultiplied alpha. This is
different than typical Flutter colors which use a `0-255` value encoding and
have unpremultipled alpha.

#### Samplers

A sampler provides access to a `dart:ui` `Image` object.
This image can be acquired either from a decoded image
or from part of the application using
[`Scene.toImageSync`][] or [`Picture.toImageSync`][].

[`Picture.toImageSync`]: https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Picture/toImageSync.html
[`Scene.toImageSync`]: https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Scene/toImageSync.html

```glsl
#include <flutter/runtime_effect.glsl>

uniform vec2 uSize;
uniform sampler2D uTexture;

out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
  vec2 uv = FlutterFragCoord().xy / uSize;
  fragColor = texture(uTexture, uv);
}
```

By default, the image uses [`TileMode.clamp`][] to determine how values outside
of the range of `[0, 1]` behave. Customization of the tile mode is not
supported and needs to be emulated in the shader.

[`TileMode.clamp`]: https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/TileMode.html

### Performance considerations

When targeting the Skia backend, loading the shader might be expensive since it
must be compiled to the appropriate platform-specific shader at runtime. If you
intend to use one or more shaders during an animation, consider precaching the
fragment program objects before starting the animation.

You can reuse a `FragmentShader` object across frames;
this is more efficient than creating a new `FragmentShader` for each frame.
