title: Support for WebAssembly (Wasm)
description: Current status of Flutter's experimental support for WebAssembly (Wasm).
short-title: Wasm
---

_WebAssembly support for Dart and Flutter is under active development. We hope
to have the feature ready to try out later in 2023._

The Flutter and Dart teams are excited to add
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) as a compilation target when building
applications for the web.

Compiling Dart to this new target requires
[WebAssembly Garbage Collection (WasmGC)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/tree/main/proposals/gc),
an upcoming addition to the WebAssembly standard. The Chrome team is actively
[working on WasmGC](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6062715726462976). You can
see the status of the GC proposal–and all other Wasm proposals–on the
[WebAssembly roadmap](https://webassembly.org/roadmap/).

In the mean time, check out Flutter's
[existing support for the web]({{site.main-url}}/multi-platform/web). We are
optimistic that existing Flutter web applications will have to do little or no
work to support WebAssembly once work is complete.
