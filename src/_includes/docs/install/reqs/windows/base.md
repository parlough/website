</div>

### Software requirements

To write and compile Flutter code for {{include.target}},
you must have the following version of Windows and the listed
software packages.

#### Operating system
{:.no_toc}

Flutter supports {{site.devmin.windows}} or later.
These versions of Windows should include the required
[Windows PowerShell][] {{site.appmin.powershell}} or later.

#### Development tools
{:.no_toc}

Download and install the Windows version of the following packages:

* [Git for Windows][] {{site.appmin.git_win}} or later to manage source code.
{% include docs/install/reqs/windows/software.md target=include.target %}

The developers of the preceding software provide support for those products.
To troubleshoot installation issues, consult that product's documentation.

{% include docs/install/reqs/flutter-sdk/flutter-doctor-precedence.md %}

## Configure a text editor or IDE

You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor or
integrated development environment (IDE) combined with
Flutter's command-line tools.

Using an IDE with a Flutter extension or plugin provides code completion,
syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, debugging, and other features.

Popular options include:

* [Visual Studio Code][] {{site.appmin.vscode}} or later
  with the [Flutter extension for VS Code][].
* [Android Studio][] {{site.appmin.android_studio}} or later
  with the [Flutter plugin for IntelliJ][].
* [IntelliJ IDEA][] {{site.appmin.intellij_idea}} or later
  with the [Flutter plugin for IntelliJ][].

:::tip
  The Flutter team recommends installing [Visual Studio Code][]
  {{site.appmin.vscode}} or later and the [Flutter extension for VS Code][].
  This combination simplifies installing the Flutter SDK.
