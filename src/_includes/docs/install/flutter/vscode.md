### Use VS Code to install Flutter
{:.no_toc}

To install Flutter using these instructions, verify that
you have installed [Visual Studio Code][]
{{site.appmin.vscode}} or later and the [Flutter extension for VS Code][].

#### Prompt VS Code to install Flutter
{:.no_toc}

1. Launch VS Code.

1. To open the **Command Palette**,
   press <kbd>{{special}}</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.

1. In the **Command Palette**, type `flutter`.

1. Select **Flutter: New Project**.

1. VS Code prompts you to locate the Flutter SDK on your computer.

   {:type="a"}
   1. If you have the Flutter SDK installed, click **Locate SDK**.

   1. If you do not have the Flutter SDK installed,
      click **Download SDK**.

      This option sends you the Flutter install page if you have not
      installed Git {% if os == "Windows" %}for Windows {% endif %}as directed in
      the [development tools prerequisites][].

1. When prompted **Which Flutter template?**, ignore it.
   Press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
   You can create a test project after checking your development setup.

#### Download the Flutter SDK
{:.no_toc}

1. When the **Select Folder for Flutter SDK** dialog displays,
   choose where you want to install Flutter.

   VS Code places you in your user profile to start.
   Choose a different location.

   {% if os == "Windows" -%}
   Consider `%USERPROFILE%` or `C:\dev`.

   {% include docs/install/admonitions/install-paths.md %}
   {% else -%}
   Consider `~/development/`
   {% endif %}

1. Click **Clone Flutter**.

   While downloading Flutter, VS Code displays this pop-up notification:

   ```console
   Downloading the Flutter SDK. This may take a few minutes.
   ```

   This download takes a few minutes.
   If you suspect that the download has hung, click **Cancel** then
   start the installation again.

1. Once it finishes downloading Flutter, the **Output** panel displays.

   ```console
   Checking Dart SDK version...
   Downloading Dart SDK from the Flutter engine ...
   Expanding downloaded archive...
   ```

   When successful, VS Code displays this pop-up notification:

   ```console
   Initializing the Flutter SDK. This may take a few minutes.
   ```

   While initializing, the **Output** panel displays the following:

   ```console
   Building flutter tool...
   Running pub upgrade...
   Resolving dependencies...
   Got dependencies.
   Downloading Material fonts...
   Downloading Gradle Wrapper...
   Downloading package sky_engine...
   Downloading flutter_patched_sdk tools...
   Downloading flutter_patched_sdk_product tools...
   Downloading windows-x64 tools...
   Downloading windows-x64/font-subset tools...
   ```

   This process also runs `flutter doctor -v`.
   At this point in the procedure, _ignore this output._
   Flutter Doctor might show errors that don't apply to this quick start.

   When the Flutter install succeeds, VS Code displays this pop-up notification:

   ```console
   Do you want to add the Flutter SDK to PATH so it's accessible
   in external terminals?
   ```

{% if os=='Windows' %}

1. Click **Add SDK to PATH**.

   When successful, a notification displays:

   ```console
   The Flutter SDK was added to your PATH
   ```

{% endif %}

1. VS Code may display a Google Analytics notice.

   If you agree, click **OK**.

1. To enable `flutter` in all {{terminal}} windows:

   {:type="a"}
   1. Close, then reopen all {{terminal}} windows.
   1. Restart VS Code.
