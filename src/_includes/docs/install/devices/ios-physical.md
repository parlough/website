#### Set up your target physical iOS device
{:.no_toc}

To deploy your Flutter app to a physical iPhone or iPad,
you need to do the following:

- Create an [Apple Developer][] account.
- Set up physical device deployment in Xcode.
- Create a development provisioning profile to self-sign certificates.
- Install the third-party CocoaPods dependency manager
  if your app uses Flutter plugins.

##### Create your Apple ID and Apple Developer account
{:.no_toc}

To test deploying to a physical iOS device, you need an Apple ID.

To distribute your app to the App Store,
you must enroll in the Apple Developer Program.

If you only need to test deploying your app,
complete the first step and move on to the next section.

1. If you don't have an [Apple ID][], create one.

1. If you haven't enrolled in the [Apple Developer][] program, enroll now.

   To learn more about membership types,

To sign an app in Xcode,
you need to create a development provisioning profile.

Follow the Xcode signing flow to provision your project.

1. Open Xcode.

1. Sign in to Xcode with your Apple ID.

   {: type="a"}
   1. Go to **Xcode** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
      **Settings...*

   . Click **+**.
   . Select **Apple ID** and click **Continue**.
   . When prompted, enter your **Apple ID** and **Password**.
   . Close the **Settings** dialog.
     Development and testing supports any Apple ID.

   drop-down menu to the right of the run button.

   It should appear under the **iOS devices** heading.

   [Apple Developer Account][] page.
   If you have not created a team, you can choose a _personal team_.

   The **Team** dropdown displays that option as **Your Name (Personal Team)**.

   ![Xcode account add][]{:.mw-100}

   After you select a team, Xcode performs the following tasks:

   {: type="a"}
   1. Creates and downloads a Development Certificate
   1. Registers your device with your account,
   1. Creates and downloads a provisioning profile if needed
      If automatic signing fails in Xcode, verify that the project's
      **General** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
      **Identity** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
      **Bundle Identifier** value is unique.
